# Sample Tools

There are many tools that could be built on top of our combined data. Here are a few proof-of-concept samples:

### Pitch Heat Map Splits (before and after injury):

![Pitch Heat Map](images/pitch_heat_map_splits.png)

These heat maps approximate the strike zone and show frequency of pitch location, over a given window of pitches thrown before and after the injury window.

### Batter Swing Rates Heat Map Splits (before and after injury):

These heat maps are a duplicate of the pitching version, but chart pitches faced by a batter, regardless of pitcher.

### Pitch Selection Graphs (before and after injury):

This bar chart shows changes in pitch selection before and after an injury.

### Future Tools

Several other possible tools have been conceptualized but not implemented, including:

- Spray charts showing at-bat outcomes, using the gameday.hitchart table.
- Line graph showing changes in average pitch velocity, leading up to and following an injury
- Aggregate charts combining the results from multiple players, all suffering similar injuriesâ€”pitch selection changes for all pitchers suffering a shoulder injury, batter avoidance of inside pitches after a broken hand, etc.
